The machine learning problem that I want to solve is predicting whether a narrated story is true or not. Specifically, I will build a machine learning model that takes as an input an audio recording of 30 seconds of duration and predicts whether the story being narrated is true or deceptive. This problem is unique because it combines elements of speech processing, behavioral analysis, and machine learning to tackle the complex and nuanced task of deception detection. This task relies on features extracted from audio recordings, such as pitch, zero-crossing rate, and MFCCs, which capture subtle vocal cues that may indicate deceptive behavior. Additionally, the temporal and psychological dynamics of storytelling make this problem challenging and different from conventional classification tasks, as it requires models to discern patterns that are often subconscious and dependent on context. It is also important to note that the audio recordings are in different languages, which is a factor that should be taken into account.
